# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the website for my book **ggplot2 extended**. It is about extending the functionality of the __[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)__ R package by **Hadley Wickham**. Many extension packages have come out since the release of __ggplot2__. This book is about how to use them to make the most out of the whole __ggplot2__ ecosystem. And which of the many extensions to use in the first place.

I will go through the very basics of how ggplot2 works in [@sec-ggplot2]. However, this book assumes some basic understanding of R and __ggplot2__.

If you're just starting with R, **R for Data Science** [@wickham2023a] is a good first stop. The book even contains [three chapters](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/visualize) on visualizing data with __ggplot2__.

For a comprehensive look into __ggplot2__ and _the grammar of graphics_ I would suggest Hadleyâ€™s book **ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis** [@wickham2016]. You can find the work-in-progress 3rd edition [online](https://ggplot2-book.org/).
