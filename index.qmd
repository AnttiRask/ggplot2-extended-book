# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the website for my book **ggplot2 extended**. As the name suggests, the book is about extending the already great functionality of the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) R package by **Hadley Wickham** with some of the most interesting extension packages that the great community has put together since the release of ggplot2.

While I will go through the basics of how ggplot2 works in [Chapter 1](https://ggplot2-extended-book.com/ggplot2), this book is primarily meant to be read after you have some basic understanding about how ggplot2 works. For learning the basics, I would suggest Hadley's book [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/). And of course, using ggplot2 in the wild.

But this book will teach you how to get the most out of ggplot2 and the ecosystem that has been built around it.

This website is and will always be free, licensed under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 DEED license. There will be a physical copy of the book, eventually. Stay tuned!
