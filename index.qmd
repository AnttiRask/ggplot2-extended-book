# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the website for my book **ggplot2 extended**. It is about extending the functionality of the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) R package by **Hadley Wickham**. There are many extension packages that have come out since the release of ggplot2. This book is about the best most useful out of them.

I will go through the basics of how ggplot2 works in @sec-ggplot2. However, this book is primarily for you if you have some basic understanding of how ggplot2 works. I would suggest you first read Hadleyâ€™s book **ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis** [@wickham2016]. The work-in-progress 3rd edition is [online](https://ggplot2-book.org/).

**R for Data Science** [@wickham2023] also has [three chapters](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/visualize) that will get you started.

This book will then teach you how to get the most out of ggplot2 and the ecosystem around it.

This website is and will always be free, licensed under the [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 DEED license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). There will be a physical copy of the book, eventually. Stay tuned!
