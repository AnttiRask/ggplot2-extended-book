# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the website for my book **ggplot2 extended**. It is about extending the functionality of the [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) R package by **Hadley Wickham**. Many extension packages have come out since the release of ggplot2. This book is about how to use them to make the most out of the whole ggplot2 ecosystem. And which of the many extensions to use in the first place.

I will go through the very basics of how ggplot2 works in [@sec-ggplot2]. However, this book assumes some basic understanding of R and ggplot2.

If you're just starting with R, **R for Data Science** [@wickham2023a] is a good first stop. The book even contains [three chapters](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/visualize) on visualizing data with ggplot2.

For a comprehensive look into ggplot2 and *the grammar of graphics* I would suggest Hadley’s book **ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis** [@wickham2016]. You can find the work-in-progress 3rd edition [online](https://ggplot2-book.org/).
